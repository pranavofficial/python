This is where I showcase my more advanced Python projects, which I am either working on or have finished.

Website Scraper ---> Basic Website Scraper that can read and store all information about a website in a database.
                    This scraper is currently set to scrape a Lego store website.
                    The scraper also takes information stored within a database and allows the user to allocate and change the store's product inventory.

Email Verification Tool ---> Allows the user to input an email and verify whether it is valid.

Mad Lib Game, Number Guessing Game, and String Analyzer ---> Basic Python projects I made, using string manipulation, integer utilization, nested for loops, and other algorithmic concepts

Text Adventure Game ---> An adventure game I programmed for fun, has many different endings and has around 30 downloads.
