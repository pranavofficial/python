This is where I showcase my more advanced python projects, that I am either working on or am finished with.

Website Scraper--->Basic Website scraper that can read and store all information about a website into a database.
                    This scraper is currently set to scrape a lego store website.
                    The scraper also takes the information stored within a database, and allows the user to allocate and change product inventory of the store.

Email Verificator--->Allows the user to input an email and verified if that email is a valid email or not.
